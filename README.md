# Health Insurance Calculator
This health insruance calculator was created as an assignment during my QQI Level 5 course in Software Development. This was a group project between myself and three students in order to teach us the fundamental of agile development, learning what the sustomer would like in the application based on a given brief.

My main responsibilities on this project was as team leader and implementing the calculations. As the team leader I was concerned with ensuring that all team members are getting work done on time to meet the schedule. While implementing the calculations I had to ensure that the calculations returned by this application were correct and matched the desired results from the project brief.
